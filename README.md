## Introduction
Welcome to the World Happiness Report Data Analysis project! In this repository, you'll find data analysis using the World Happiness Report dataset for years 2015 to 2023. This project aims to explore, visualize, and derive insights from the data to better understand the factors that contribute to happiness across different countries.
## Overview 
The World Happiness Report is a valuable dataset that provides insights into the well-being and happiness of people in various countries. This project's primary goals are as follows:

* Data Collection: We've collected, cleaned and merged the World Happiness Report datas in Jupyter notebook using Pandas library, making it ready for analysis.

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performed exploratory data analysis to understand Ten top and bottom countries happiness scores, created sunburst chart to analyse happiness score across various regions and sub-regions using plotly.express.

* Visualization: Create informative visualizations to communicate your findings effectively. These may include scatter plots, bar charts, heatmaps, and more.

## Dataset
The World Happiness Report dataset contains information about happiness scores and various contributing factors, including economic, social, and health-related variables for multiple countries over several years.

## The Cantril Ladder
The World Happiness Report takes data from the Gallup World Poll surveys and formulates them into what is called the Cantril Self-Anchoring Striving Scale, or the Cantril Ladder. Developed by Dr. Hadley Cantril in 1965, it asks respondents to imagine a ladder with steps numbered from zero at the bottom to 10 at the top.


The top of the ladder represents the best possible life for you and the bottom represents the worst possible life. Pollers are then asked which step of the ladder they feel they are on.
"Thriving" respondents had ratings of 7 or higher and reported significantly fewer health problems, less stress and anger.
Ratings of 5-6 categorized as "Struggling", with more daily stress and worries about money than "Thriving" respondents. 
Ratings of 4 and below fall into the "Suffering" category, where well-being is at high risk, and usually report lacking basic needs such as food and shelter, and less access to healthcare.

## Inspiration

* What countries or regions rank the highest in overall happiness and each of the six factors contributing to happiness? How did country ranks or scores change between the 2015 and 2023 reports? Did any country experience a significant increase or decrease in happiness?

## Wha
## World Happiness Index
The World Happiness Index suggests 6 key leading indicators for happiness:  GDP per capita, Social Support, healthy life expectancy, generosity, freedom to make life choices, and perception of corruption.

## Observations
  *  Economy is highly correlated with Health, Social Support and Trust.
  *  Health is highly correlated with Social Support and moderately correlated with Freedom and Trust.
  *  Freedom is moderately correlated with other attributes.
  *  Generosity is only moderately correlated with Freedom, while its correlation with other attributes is weak.
